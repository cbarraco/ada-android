    <h1>Ada</h1>
    <p>Ada is a voice assistant built into Home Assistant and provides voice control of Home Assistant integrations.</p>
    <p>I decided to implement this Android app to make Ada more accessible and convenient to use. More specifically, I wanted to make Ada available as an Assistant app so it can be started from the Assistant button on compatible headphones.</p>

    <p><b>Features:</b></p>
    <p>
        - Familiar UI consistent with Ada on the Lovelace UI.<br/>
        - Easy to set up, just enter Home Assistant URL and Long-lived access token in Settings.<br/>
        - Voice recognition runs locally on the device, so no internet connection is required as long as Home Assistant is accessible.<br/>
        - Ada is recognized by Android as an Assistant app so it can be set as the default Assistant in the Android settings app.
        - Voice recognition runs as a Service, so Ada can be accessed when the screen is locked via the Assistant button on compatible headphones.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>Ada needs permission to access the microphone to provide voice recognition.</p>

    <p>Root access is not required to use this app.</p>
